			<h4 class="content">Amor Towles</h4>
			<p class="content">"In June, 1954, eighteen-year-old Emmett Watson is driven home to Nebraska 
				by the warden of the work farm where he has just served a year for involuntary manslaughter. 
				His mother long gone, his father recently deceased, and the family farm foreclosed upon by the bank, 
				Emmett’s intention is to pick up his eight-year-old brother and head west where they can start their 
				lives anew. But when the warden drives away, Emmett discovers that two friends from the work farm have 
				hidden themselves in the trunk of the warden’s car. Together, they have hatched an altogether different 
				plan for Emmett’s future.
				<br>
				<br>Spanning just ten days and told from multiple points of view, Towles’s third novel will satisfy fans 
				of his multi-layered literary styling while providing them an array of new and richly imagined settings, 
				characters, and themes," (Goodreads).</p>
