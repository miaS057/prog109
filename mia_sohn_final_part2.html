  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
  <p>I had zero previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript except that they
  were used to create websites.</p>
  <h3>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h3>
  <p>I used the template from Module Assignment 4</p>
  <h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h3>
  <p>The most challenging part was formatting everything to look nice, especially the validation page.</p>
  <h3>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </h3>
  <p>Since I did not have any knowledge of Web Development prior to taking this class, I did not have
  a particular view about it, but after taking this class, I can see the amount of effort that is
  needed to keep everything organized and formatted nicely.</p>
  <h3>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
  <p>I would recommned to always read the rubric and to start assignments ahead of time so that
  there is plenty of time to play around with the code and search things up if necessary.</p>
